# Inductor Generator


Spiral geometry defined by:
- Outer length / width (L)
- Conductor width (W)
- Conductor spacing (S)
- Number of turns (N)

For a given area (A) and metal/oxide/substrate layers, we
wish to select the best (or desired):
- Quality factor (Q)
- Inductance (L)
- Q Â· L product
- Self-Resonance Frequency (SRF)
- Parasitic Capacitance (Csub, Cox, Cc)

$$\int_{a}^{b} x^2 dx$$
